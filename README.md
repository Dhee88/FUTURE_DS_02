# Customer Retention & Churn Analysis
Data Science & Analytics – Task 2 (2026)
Future Interns

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn and retention patterns for a subscription-based business. The goal is to identify key churn drivers, high-risk customer segments, and actionable strategies to improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss.

## Dataset
Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle), containing customer demographics, tenure, contract details, payment methods, monthly charges, and churn status.

## Tools Used
- Python: Data cleaning, feature engineering, churn and retention analysis
- Power BI: Interactive dashboard and business-focused visualization

## Analysis Highlights
- Calculated churn rate, retention rate, average tenure, and revenue at risk
- Analyzed churn across contract types and tenure groups
- Compared monthly charges for churned vs retained customers
- Examined churn trends using tenure-based line charts

## Key Insights
- Churn is highest within the first 6 months of customer tenure
- Month-to-month contracts show significantly higher churn than long-term plans
- Higher monthly charges are associated with increased churn risk
- Long-tenure customers demonstrate stronger retention

## Business Recommendations
- Focus retention efforts on the first 6 months of the customer lifecycle
- Incentivize customers to move to long-term contracts
- Monitor high-paying customers and apply targeted retention strategies

## Deliverables
- Power BI dashboard with KPIs, segmentation, and churn trends
- Cleaned dataset and analysis workflow included in this repository

## Acknowledgement
Completed as part of Future Interns – Data Science & Analytics Task 2 (2026).
